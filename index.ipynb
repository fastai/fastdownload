The path to the extracted file is returned. If that URL has already been downloaded, then the cached archive or contents will be used automatically. However, if that size or hash of the archive is different to what it should be, then the user will be informed, and a new version will be downloaded.\n",

The files are automatically placed in appropriate subdirectories of a `.fastai` folder in the user's homedir. If a dataset is updated, users are informed the next time they use the dataset, and the latest version is automatically downloaded and extracted for them."
